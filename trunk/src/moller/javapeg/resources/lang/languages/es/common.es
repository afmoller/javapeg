# This is the Spanish language file for the common strings.

# The structure of the file is as follows:

# A line starting with "#" is interpreted as a comment.

# A valid non comment line may look like "file = Arkiv" where "file" is the variable, = the
# separator and "Arkiv" is the value of the variable, in this case the Swedish word for file.

# There might be whitespaces or tabs in between the variable and the "=". Any whitespace
# or other character after the value of the variable will be trimmed away.

# For more information regarding the rules for the syntax of this file please visit:
