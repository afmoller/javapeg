<LF>
<LF>
The application still need a path to a source directory with images. When the source directory has been chosen the destination directory must be selected.

<LF>
<LF>
A major difference with this version compared to the 1.x versions it that this version only supports renaming of copied image files. The reason for this is to minimize the risk for data losses.
<LF>
<LF>
