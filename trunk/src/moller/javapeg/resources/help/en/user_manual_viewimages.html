===========<br />
The following text will describe how an image list is created and how that list can be saved, exported and or viewed in the Image Viewer. In other words start reading by going to next paragraph.

Click on the tab with the label "VIEW IMAGES"
<br />
<br />
3:<br />
Now it is possible to add images to the list by right clicking the thumbnails that is displayed. Either it is possible to add only the marked image or all images in the selected directory. It is possible to add the same image(s) multiple times if wanted.
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
