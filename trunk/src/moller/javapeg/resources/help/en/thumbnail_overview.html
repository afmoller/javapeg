        <b><u>CREATE THUMBNAIL OVERVIEW</u></b><br />
        JavaPEG has the possibility to create a thumb nail overview in the form of a HTML document, which shows thumb nail versions of the files that has been renamed. Each thumb nail links to the full size image. The purpose of this overview is to offer a quick and easy way to see which images there is in a directory.
        <br />
        <br />
        The look and feel of the thumb nail overview is possible to change by creating a layout.xml and / or a style.css file. The content and syntax of these files are described in the following two files: layout.info and style.info. They are stored at the following location: <install directory of JavaPEG>/resources/thumb/
        <br />
        <br />
        It is not mandatory to create both the files. It is perfectly legal to create only one of them if desired. The file / files must be created in the same location as the above info files are stored.
