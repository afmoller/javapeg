		<b><u>INCONSISTENT META DATA BASE FILE</u></b><br />
		A meta data base file can be inconsistent in two ways:<br />
		<br />
		1: The number of image files listed in the meta data base file does not correspond with the number of image files that actually exist in the directory where the meta data base file is stored.<br />
		<br />
		2: The names of the image files listed in the meta data base file does not correspond with the names of the image files that actually exist in the directory where the meta data base file is stored.<br />
		<br />
		<b><u>SOLUTION</u></b><br />
		The inconsistent meta data base file must be opened in an text editor and edited in such a way that it does correspond with the number of image files, in the directory where the image meta data base file is stored, and the names of those.
