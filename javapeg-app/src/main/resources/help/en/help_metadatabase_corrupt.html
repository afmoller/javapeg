        <b><u>IMAGE META DATA BASE FILE CORRUPT</u></b><br />
        An image meta data base file is corrupt when the content does not match the by JavaPEG specified format (XML Schema (.xsd)). If an image meta data base is corrupt it does mean that JavaPEG does not have the possibility to read (parse) the content of the image meta data base file.<br />
        <br />
        Unless the image meta data base file is manually edited, outside of JavaPEG, this should not happen, and if it does happen then it is probably an bug in JavaPEG.<br />
        <br />
        <b><u>SOLUTION</u></b><br />
        If an image meta data base file is corrupt, then the cause is logged in the JavaPEG log file. Open the log file in an text editor and locate the error message and do what the error message and if the error message can be related to an manual edit of the image meta data base file, then try to repair the image meta data base file with help of the error message. Otherwise create an bug report by sending a message at the following web page: https://sourceforge.net/users/fredrik_m
