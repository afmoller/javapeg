 In the sub directory where this file can be found it is possible to put 
 customized translations of, the help files used by JavaPEG. It is both 
 possible to override an existing help files language and to create an entire
 new translation for a non existing language. For a new language that does
 not already exist in JavaPEG, then there also has to be a corresponding
 language.** file added to the <JavaPEG base directory>/resources/lang
 directory. See the language.info file for more information about creating
 this language file.
