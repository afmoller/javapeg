It is possible to search for images by supplying search criteria within four different areas: CATEGOIRES, IMAGE META DATA, RATING and COMMENT.<LF>

CATEGORIES: Select the category / the categories which shall be included in the search. The category search has two search modes: AND or OR. In the case of AND search all selected categories must be set to an image to have that image added to the search result. OR search, makes any image that have any of the selected categories to end up in the search result.<LF>

IMAGE META DATA: This is information which is automatically retrieved from the image meta data information. The searchable values are the ones which are stored in the image repository for each meta data attribute. For each meta data attribute, except for CAMERA MODEL (which only have equals to), it is possible to search in three modes: lesser than, equals to and larger than. In the case with lesser than and larger than only one meta data attribute value shall be selected and all images which have a value lesser than respectively larger than the selected value will be added to the search result. For the equal to search it is possible to select multiple values and all images matching any of the selected values will be added to the search result.<LF>

RATING: Here it is possible to select different ratings to search for. It is an "OR" search that is performed, which means that every image which matches any of the selected ratings will be added to the search result.<LF>

COMMENT: Makes it possible to search on entered image comments. The search is a "contains" search. This means that if an image has the comment "An image comment" the the search phrase "image" will put that image to the search result.<LF>

The four separate areas of search criteria works as filtering search, which means that the more search criteria that is selected the more narrow the search result will be except for RATING and CATEGORIES (if OR mode is activated).<LF>
