===================<LF>
JavaPEG has the possibility to change the file names of jpeg images that contains Exif data, Exchangeable Image File Format. The majority of digital cameras supports this format and saves thereby meta data (information about the file itself) when the image is saved to the media storage of the camera. An example of meta data might be the date when the image was shot.

As an addition to the rename feature JavaPEG also has the possibility to create thumb nail overviews. These overviews shows thumb nail versions of the full size images. Below each thumb nail it is possible to show meta data about the full size image. Each thumb nail is linked to the full size image. These overviews are created in the HTML format and the purpose with them are that it shall be easy to get an overview of which images that are present in a directory.

It is  also possible to create image lists (slide shows) with JavaPEG. It is possible to create lists in an internal JavaPEG format, which might be saved and later on opened again for further processing. It is also possible to export image lists to format supported by third party software. This makes it possible for further processing of the lists in the third party software or to show the images in the image list.

There is also an embedded Image Viewer available, which displays images that have been gathered in an image list (same list as the one mentioned above). The image viewer offer possibility to navigate forward and backwards in the list of images and it is also possible to directly view any image in the list by clicking a thumbnail version in the user interface. The image viewer can also show detailed meta data information about the displayed image. It is also possible to let the viewer automatically resize the image to fit the current screen size. Another feature is that it is possible to allow the image viewer to automatically rotate the images to the correct orientation (Exif orientation).

JavaPEG also has the possibility to organize images in a searchable data base. The data base is decentralized and consists of XML files, which are created in each directory with images. The XML files are created either; automatically when a directory with images is browsed in JavaPEG, or after JavaPEG has asked if the directory shall be added to the image database, or not at all. The adding behavior is configurable in the settings of JavaPEG. It is possible to assign an image a: comment, a rating and an unlimited amount of categories. Besides from that a selection of Exif information is automatically stored to the data base. The data base i searchable for all criterias in any combination.
